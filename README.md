This branch contains the website for STAT 201, in the `docs` folder.

From Rodolfo:

> I have made it more manageable.  You can check the website here: https://ubc-stat.github.io/stat-201/

> The website documents are in the stat-201 repo, branch website, folder docs.
> https://github.com/UBC-STAT/stat-201/tree/website/docs

> So, the way I set up the website is that, each page (.html) will have a sister .md page with the same name but with an appended -page

> For example, if you want to change the syllabus.html webpage, you can edit  syllabus-page.md

> You can use regular markdown. You don't need to render or do anything else. The website will take care of the rest. So feel free to edit as you need.

> We are using this same template in STAT 200, 201, 301, 450, and 538.

> There are some top menus (and submenus) that is also possible to add/remove. Right now, there's a specific workflow for that (by editing simultaneously multiple html file in vscode) -- e.g., add a navigation menu for the assignments.

> I can help you with that if you need. I plan on soon making a more automatic process.
