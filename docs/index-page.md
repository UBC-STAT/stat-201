### Course Description

Data Science skills and tools have been increasingly in demand in the last few years. This course is designed
as a method of furthering experience and gaining such skills in the specific area of applications of
statistical inference. STAT 201 will explain key concepts through the analysis of data while exploring
various and diverse case studies. Special attention will be given to writing computer scripts to create
reproducible analyses. In this course, students will be introduced to classical results based on exact and
approximate distributional theory in comparison with results derived from simulation-based or resampling
approaches, such as permutation and bootstrapping. The resampling framework allows the course to go beyond
inference for means and proportions to other parameters needed in practice. This course will be
computationally heavy, therefore, students will become well versed in implementing these concepts by writing
computer scripts suitable for modern data analysis (e.g. R). There will be an emphasis on reproducible
workflows, clear communication of findings and a general understanding of key concepts decontextualized from
specific applications.
