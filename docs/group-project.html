        <h2>Group Project</h2>
        <p>As in DSCI 100, students will work in groups to complete a Data Science project from the beginning
            (downloading data from the web) to the end (communicating their methods and conclusions in an electronic
            report). However, this time, your project will focus on statistical inference. Remember, a fundamental theme
            in this course is that, in addition to drawing conclusions (such as computing an estimate), it’s critical to
            communicate the evidence and uncertainty associated with the conclusion. The latter is the main focus of
            this project and will manifest in an electronic report.</p>
        <p>The electronic report will be a Jupyter notebook in which the code cells will download a dataset from the
            web, reproducibly and sensibly wrangle and clean, summarize and visualize the data, as well as appropriately
            answer an inferential question. Throughout the document, markdown cells will be used to communicate the
            question asked, methods used, and the conclusion reached.</p>
        <p>For this project, you will need to formulate and answer an inferential question about a dataset of your
            choice. We list some suggested data sets below; however, we encourage you to use another data set that
            interests you. If you are unsure whether your dataset is adequate, please reach out to a member of the
            teaching team.</p>


        <h3>Deliverable 1: Team Contract</h3>
        <p>A group contract is a document to help you formalize the expectations you have for your group members and
            what
            they can expect of you. It will help you think about what you need from each other to work effectively as a
            team!
            You will create and agree on this contract as a team. <strong>Each member should "sign" (you can just type
                out your name)
                at the bottom of the submission</strong>.</p>
        <p>At a minimum, your group contract must address the following:</p>

        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>What are our team goals for this project?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What do we want to accomplish?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What skills do we want to develop or refine?</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Expectations</h4>
        <p>What do we expect of one another regarding attendance at meetings, participation, frequency of communication,
            quality of work, etc.?</p>

        <h4>Policies & Procedures</h4>
        <p>What rules can we agree on to help us meet our goals and expectations?</p>

        <h4>Consequences:</h4>
        <p>How will we address non-performance regarding these goals, expectations, policies and procedures?</p>



        <h3>Deliverable 2: Project Proposal</h3>
        <p>Each group is expected to prepare a written proposal within 500 words
            (about 1 page) that identifies the dataset they plan to work on, as well
            as the question they would like to answer using that dataset for their
            group project. The proposal should be done in a Jupyter notebook, and
            then submitted both as an <code>.html</code> file (<code>File</code> &#8594; <code>Download As</code>
            &#8594;
            <code>HTML</code>) and
            an <code>.ipynb</code> file that is reproducible (i.e. works and runs without any
            additional files).
        </p>

        <p>Only one member of your team needs to submit. You must submit <strong>two files</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>the source Jupyter notebook (<code>.ipynb</code> file)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>the rendered final document (<code>.html</code> file)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Each proposal should include the following sections:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Title</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Introduction</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Preliminary Results</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Methods: Plan</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>References</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h4> Introduction</h4>

        <p>Begin by providing some relevant background information on the topic so
            that someone unfamiliar with it will be prepared to understand the rest
            of your proposal.</p>

        <p>Clearly state the question you will try to answer with your project.
            Your question should involve one random variable of interest, spread
            across two or more categories that are interesting to compare. For
            example, you could consider the annual maxima river flow at two
            different locations along a river, or perhaps gender diversity at
            different universities. Of the response variable, identify one location
            parameter (mean, median, quantile, etc.) and one scale parameter
            (standard deviation, inter-quartile range, etc.) that would be useful in
            answering your question. Justify your choices.</p>

        <p>Identify and describe the dataset that will be used to answer the
            question. Remember, this dataset is allowed to contain more variables
            than you need – feel free to drop them!</p>

        <p>Also, be sure to frame your question/objectives in terms of what is
            already known in the literature. Be sure to include at least two
            scientific publications that can help frame your study (you will need to
            include these in the References section).</p>

        <h4>Preliminary Results</h4>

        <p>In this section, you will:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Demonstrate that the dataset can be read from the web into R.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Clean and wrangle your data into a tidy format.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Plot the relevant raw data, tailoring your plot in a way that</p>
            </li>
            addresses your question.
            <li>
                <p>Compute estimates of the parameter you identified across your
                    groups. Present this in a table. If relevant, include these
                    estimates in your plot.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Be sure to not print output that takes up a lot of screen space.</p>

        <h4> Methods: Plan</h4>

        <p>The previous sections will carry over to your final report (you’ll be
            allowed to improve them based on feedback you get). Begin this <em>Methods</em>
            section with a brief description of “the good things” about this report
            – specifically, in what ways is this report trustworthy?</p>

        <p>Continue by explaining why the plot(s) and estimates that you produced
            are not enough to give to a stakeholder, and what you should provide in
            addition to address this gap. Make sure your plans include at least one
            hypothesis test and one confidence interval, with at least one of these
            being calculated using both bootstrapping and asymptotics for
            comparison.</p>

        <p>Finish this section by reflecting on how your final report might play
            out:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> What do you expect to find?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> What impact could such findings have?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> What future questions could this lead to?</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>References</h4>

        <p>At least two citations of literature relevant to the project. The citation
            format is your choice – just be consistent. Make sure to cite the source
            of your data as well.</p>

        <h3>Deliverable 3: Peer Review</h3>

        <p>For this peer review, you will be <strong>individually</strong> providing feedback to
            another group’s proposal. You will be sent an email with the proposal to
            review.</p>

        <p>We deliberately set up the review so that each member of your group is
            assigned to review a *different* group’s proposal. This allows your
            group to collectively see a larger variety of proposals.</p>

        <h4>Instructions</h4>

        <p>Bundle all of your feedback into a single document of your choice, and
            submit that to canvas. There is no page limit. The teaching team will
            deliver the feedback to your reviewee.</p>

        <p>Your review should contain the following elements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>As you read through the proposal, point out anything that you think is confusing, or is not
                    communicated effectively. When possible, provide suggestions for improvement. If everything looks
                    good to you, say why it looks good.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What part of the proposal is the most effective, and why?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What part of the proposal is the least effective, and why? Provide a suggestion for improvement.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Provide feedback on English, spelling, and grammar (if applicable).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The rubric can be found on canvas. In short, <em>mechanics</em> (10%) evaluates
            the composition of your submission, <em>reasoning</em> (70%) evaluates your
            feedback, and <em>writing</em> (20%) evaluates your English, spelling, and
            grammar.</p>

        <h3>Deliverable 4: Final Report</h3>

        <p>Each group will create a final electronic report (max 2000 written
            words, not including citations) using Jupyter to communicate the
            question asked, the analysis performed and the conclusion reached.</p>

        <p>Only one member of your team needs to submit. You must submit <strong>two
                files</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>the source Jupyter notebook (<code>.ipynb</code> file)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>the rendered final document (<code>.html</code> file)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each report should include the following sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Title</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Introduction</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Methods and Results</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Discussion</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>References</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Introduction</h4>

        <p>The instructions for this section are the same in your proposal. Just be
            sure to improve this section by incorporating feedback, and changing
            things based on your own improved understanding of the project (now that
            more time has passed since the proposal).</p>

        <h4>Methods and Results</h4>

        <p>Here is where you’ll include your work from the “Preliminary Results” in
            your proposal, along with the additional results you planned to conduct,
            as indicated in the “Methods: Plan” section of your proposal. Be sure to
            incorporate feedback from the teaching team and your peers (as
            relevant), or make any improvements based on your own improved
            understanding of the project (now that more time has passed since the
            proposal).</p>

        <p>Specifically, in addition to what is requested in the “Preliminary
            Results” section of the proposal, we are looking for the following
            components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Describe in written English the methods you used to perform your
                analysis from beginning to end that narrates the code the does the
                analysis.
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure to interpret the results you obtain. It’s not enough
                        to just state what a 90% confidence interval is, for example.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Ensure your tables and/or figures are labeled with a figure/table
                number.</li>

            <li>Do you think one of bootstrapping or asymptotics is more appropriate
                than the other? Why or why not? Explain why you think both methods
                gave you similar/different results, and whether you think one is
                more trustworthy than the other.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Discussion</h4>

        <p>In this section, you’ll interpret the results you obtained in the
            previous section with respect to the main question/goal of your project.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Summarize what you found, and the implications/impact of your findings.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If relevant, discuss whether your results were what you expected to find.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Discuss future questions/research this study could lead to.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>References</h4>

        <p>The same instructions for your proposal also applies here. You only need
            to make changes if necessary (e.g., if feedback indicates so).</p>


        <h3>Deliverable 5: Team Evaluation</h3>

        <p>Evaluate each member of your group (including yourself) in terms of how they/you participated,
            prepared, helped the group excel, and was a team player.</p>

        <p>Click the Teammate Evaluation Template link in the Canvas home page to access the teamwork document
            (or try this URL: /courses/65765/files/14148078). Fill out the jupyter notebook, then download an
            html rendering of the completed notebook by going to <code>File</code> &#8594; <code>Download As</code>
            &#8594; <code>HTML</code>. Finally, submit the rendered HTML document here.</p>

        <p>- This is <strong>not</strong> a group submission. Every member of the group must complete and submit this
            individually.</p>
        </li>
        <p>- This is <strong>not</strong> a standard worksheet/tutorial. You <strong>must</strong> download off our
            server and submit the html to Canvas.</p>

            <li>Maybe do your own experiment or observational study, if you have time – or maybe you already have the
                data. For example, do you track your daily step count? If so, you could come up with some criteria to
                determine whether you have been satisfying the goal, and use your daily step counts. You could see how
                your performance holds up depending on the day of week (or maybe whether or not it’s a weekday), or
                perhaps across different group members.</li>
