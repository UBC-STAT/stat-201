        <h2>Group Project</h2>
        <p>As in DSCI 100, students will work in groups to complete a Data Science project from the beginning
            (downloading data from the web) to the end (communicating their methods and conclusions in an electronic
            report). However, this time, your project will focus on statistical inference. Remember, a fundamental theme
            in this course is that, in addition to drawing conclusions (such as computing an estimate), it’s critical to
            communicate the evidence and uncertainty associated with the conclusion. The latter is the main focus of
            this project and will manifest in an electronic report.</p>
        <p>The electronic report will be a Jupyter notebook in which the code cells will download a dataset from the
            web, reproducibly and sensibly wrangle and clean, summarize and visualize the data, as well as appropriately
            answer an inferential question. Throughout the document, markdown cells will be used to communicate the
            question asked, methods used, and the conclusion reached.</p>
        <p>For this project, you will need to formulate and answer an inferential question about a dataset of your
            choice. We list some suggested data sets below; however, we encourage you to use another data set that
            interests you. If you are unsure whether your dataset is adequate, please reach out to a member of the
            teaching team.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>City of Vancouver data: <a href="https://opendata.vancouver.ca/pages/home/"
                    class="uri">https://opendata.vancouver.ca/pages/home/</a> (or other cities, like Ottawa, Toronto,
                etc.)</li>
            <li>Vancouver crime data: <a href="https://geodash.vpd.ca/opendata/"

                    class="uri">https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/water-overview/quantity/monitoring/survey.html</a>
            </li>
            <li>Climate and Weather Data: <a href="https://climate.weather.gc.ca/"
                    class="uri">https://climate.weather.gc.ca/</a></li>
            <li>Sports data</li>
            <li>Maybe do your own experiment or observational study, if you have time – or maybe you already have the
                data. For example, do you track your daily step count? If so, you could come up with some criteria to
                determine whether you have been satisfying the goal, and use your daily step counts. You could see how
                your performance holds up depending on the day of week (or maybe whether or not it’s a weekday), or
                perhaps across different group members.</li>
