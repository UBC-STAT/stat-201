        <h2>Code of conduct</h2>
        <p>For STAT 201, we are committed to creating a friendly, respectful,
            and supportive place for all people, no exceptions. As such, we do
            not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our teachers or learners
            or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We
            do not tolerate discrimination or harassment. All participants in our
            course are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. Everyone
            participating in STAT 201 activities is required to conform to this Code of Conduct.</p>

        <p>
            This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by STAT 201 including,
            but not limited to, class meetings, email communication,
            and online forums such as Piazza and GitHub.
            The STAT 201 teaching team are expected to assist with the enforcement
            of the Code of Conduct, and all reports will be kept confidential.
        </p>

        <h3>Expected Behavior</h3>

        <p>All participants in our events and communications are expected to show
            respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional
            regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster
            a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following
            kinds of behaviours in all STAT 201 events and platforms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Use welcoming and inclusive language</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Gracefully accept constructive criticism</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Focus on what is best for the community</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Show courtesy and respect towards other community members</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: See the four social rules for further recommendations.</p>

        <h3>Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
        <p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants at any STAT 201 event/platform include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people
                    on the basis of membership of any specific group</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking,
                    following, or intimidation</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>violent threats or language directed against another person</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>the display of sexual or violent images</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>unwelcome sexual attention</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>sustained disruption of talks, events or communications</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>insults or put downs</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>excessive swearing</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording)
                    with someone after being asked to stop publication of private
                    communication without consent</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
        <p>Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to
            comply immediately. This applies to any STAT 201 events and platforms, either
            online or in-person. If a participant engages in behavior that violates this
            code of conduct, the teaching team may warn the offender and or engage the
            STAT 201 Instructor to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose
            appropriate sanctions.</p>

        <h3>Incident Reporting Guidelines</h3>
        <p>If someone violates the Code of Conduct during a STAT 201 event or in an online
            space outside of organised events, we ask that you report it to the instructor.
            The current instructor of STAT 201 is Rodolfo Lourenzutti.
            An email to lourenzutti@stat.ubc.ca will be seen by Rodolfo.
            To report a STAT 201 code of conduct violation that will not be seen by Rodolfo,
            an alternative contact person is Tiffany Timbers, Professor of Teaching in the
            Department of Statistics at UBC. Her email is tiffany.timbers@stat.ubc.ca.</p>
