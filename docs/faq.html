        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        
        
        <h3>What is the structure of the class?</h3>
        <p>Each week will have the following pattern:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Read the required reading materials before lecture. 
                You can find them in <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a>.</p></li>
            <li><p>The worksheets and tutorials will be released on Monday 
                and will be due on Saturday at 11:59pm pacific time.</p></li>
            <li><p>In the first lecture of the week, we will begin with a 
                brief lecture to introduce new concepts. Then you will have 
                time to work on the lecture worksheet to practice the concepts.</p></li>
            <li><p>In the second lecture of the week, the TAs will run a tutorial 
                to reinforce the concept we learned on Monday. You'll have time in 
                this session to work on the tutorial to practice the concept. The 
                tutorials are generally harder than the worksheets.</p></li>
            <li><p>Sunday is free day. You'll have nothing to do for this course. Woohoo!</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This course will have 3 quizzes: two midterms and one final exam. 
            The first two (i.e., the midterms) will be held in class, and the 
            last one will be during the exam period, but they will all be the 
            same format (unless otherwise notified).
            Also, there will be a class project, which you will complete with a 
            randomly-assigned group.</p>

        
        
        <h3>How do I submit an assignment?</h3>
        <p> You must complete all of your lecture 
            and tutorial worksheets on our JupyterHub server. Once you are done 
            working, just go to File -&gt; Save and Checkpoint, and make sure 
            the checkpoint is "a few seconds ago" at the top of your screen. 
            You don't need to click "submit" anywhere -- our server will automatically 
            take a snapshot of your assignment at the due date. 
            Make sure you <strong>do not</strong> move nor rename your assignment from where it originally 
            was on the server.</p>

        
        
        <h3>How do I get my assignment regraded?</h3>
        <p>Per the <a href="syllabus.html#regrading">syllabus</a>: the TA who graded the assignment will 
            take a second look at it. Post on Piazza using a private message to the teaching team and 
            we will respond there.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Select <code>New Post</code> on Piazza.</p></li>
            <li><p>Under <code>Post to:</code>, select <code>Individual Student(s) / Instructor(s)</code> and type
                    <code>Instructors</code> in the blank field.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Under <code>Select Folder(s):</code> choose the <code>regrades</code> folder</p></li>
            <li>
            <p>In <code>Summary:</code> type the name of the assessment you want regraded and your student number (e.g. worksheet 1, #12345678)</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>In <code>Details:</code> write a brief explanation of why you are requesting the regrade</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: We will only regrade to correct the mistakes that we made when grading. 
            After one week of having the grade returned to you, we may deny your request 
            for re-evaluation. Please see the syllabus for our policy regarding auto-grading.</p>

        <h3>Where do I find due dates?</h3>
        <p>You can find them in <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a>. They are also listed on Canvas.</p>

        <h3>What if I registered late? When are things due?</h3>
        <p>Hi! Welcome to STAT 201 -- glad to have you on board. Since we have a new assignment 
            in every class session, there are already a few assignments to catch up on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>If you registered after a class session already happened, then the assignment 
                from that class session will be due exactly 1 week after your registration date time.</p></li>
            <li><p>If you registered before a class session happens, the assignment from that class 
                is due at the normal time.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>I'm going to be late/absent for a class! Who do I notify?</h3>
        <p>I do not need to be informed when you'll be absent from a regular class. 
            I understand that not everyone will be able to attend the lecture/tutorial sessions. 
            There are no marks assigned for attending class. I am hoping the flexibility of 
            this course will allow you to access the learning materials wherever you are and 
            whenever you need them.</p>
        <p>If you are going to be absent from a quiz, you need to fill out a self-declared 
            concession form in a timely manner. See the course policies on the syllabus for details.</p>

        <h3>Do I satisfy the math requirement for this class?</h3>
        <p>Yes. There is no hard math prerequisite; MATH12 (or equivalent) is suggested but not required.</p>

        <h3>How do I get help in the course?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>During Lectures and Tutorials sessions: you can use lecture and tutorial time to ask questions, 
                discuss and receive individual feedback regarding your worksheets, tutorials, or group project. 
                The instructors, the TAs and your fellow classmates will be available to help you work through 
                the problems!</p></li>
            <li><p>Office Hours: The TAs and instructors will hold office hours at various times throughout the week 
                via Zoom. I encourage you to ask questions about the worksheets, tutorials, the project or any other 
                questions about the course material!</p></li>
            <li><p>Piazza Discussion Board: You can post on the Piazza Discussion board to ask your questions about the course material. You can also help your classmates by answering their questions!</p></li>
            <li><p>Email: If you have personal questions that do not pertain to the course material itself you can email us. For questions about the course material, please post your questions on Piazza! Please note: I respond to emails M - F, and I try my best to answer you as promptly as possible, however, given the large class size I may take a few days to respond.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How do I do well in this course?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Most importantly: complete the lecture and tutorial worksheets. 
                These are designed to help you learn the concepts so you'll do well 
                on the project and quizzes. The worksheets tend to be a bit easier 
                and provide more guidance. The tutorials are more difficult and give 
                you a good sense of how well you've learned the material. Students who 
                make an effort to complete all of the worksheets and tutorials tend to 
                perform well in the class. <em>Note: You can collaborate with your peers -- this is encouraged! -- 
                as discussing the material while you work on it will help you learn. 
                But you are not allowed to simply copy another student's work. That 
                is plagiarism, which is expressly forbidden in the course policy.</em></p>               
            </li>
            <li><p>Time management is very important in this course, especially in the summer session. 
                There are regular assessments every week to keep you on track, but we move quickly 
                and cover a lot of ground.
                <a style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;" title="http://learningcommons.ubc.ca/time-management/" href="http://learningcommons.ubc.ca/time-management/" target="new">The time management toolkit on the Learning Commons website</a>
                may be a useful tool for you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p>Take an active role in the learning community that we will build together. 
                Ask questions on Piazza when you have them, and try to answer each others' questions when you can.
                We understand that not everyone will be able to attend the synchronous sessions. 
                Therefore we will use both <em>asynchronous</em> (not at the same time) and 
                <em>synchronous</em> (at the same time) tools. The asynchronous communication tools 
                include the Piazza discussion board, Canvas announcements 
                (<a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10592-4212710338"> make sure your email 
                    is up-to-date on Canvas!</a>) and email, whereas the synchronous tool we will use is Zoom (for office hours, tutorials and lecture).
                We are here to support your learning, and we hope you will support each other along the way as well. 
                We look forward to working together with you this term!</p>
