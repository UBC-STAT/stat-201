<h3 id="Assessments">Assessments</h3>
<p> Each week there will be two assignments: (1) worksheets; and (2) tutorials.
    The assignments will be due every Saturday, 23:59:59. The worksheets are
    fully autograded with visible tests to help you identify points that need
    more clarification. Therefore, reach out to the teaching team if you don't
    understand why you are getting an answer wrong in the worksheet. On the
    other hand, the tutorials are not fully autograded, and only a few exercises
    will have visible tests. You can access the assignments through Canvas (<a
        href="https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/74942/assignments">assignments</a>).</p>
<p>To submit your assignment, make sure your work is saved
    <strong>on our server</strong> (i.e., using the link from Canvas) before the deadline.
    Our server will automatically snapshot at the due date/time. Also, please <strong>do not</strong> rename the
    assignments files.

<h3 id="Policies">Policies</h3>

<h4> Late/Absence</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Regular attendance to lecture and tutorials is expected of students.
            Students who are unavoidably absent because of illness or other reasons
            should inform the instructor(s) of the course as soon as possible, preferably,
            prior to the start of the lecture/tutorial. </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>There will be no make-up exams. Students who miss Midterm 1, Midterm 2
            or an assignment and want to request an Academic Concession need to contact
            the Instructor as soon as possible and provide a <a href="">self-declaration form</a>.
            Failing to present a declaration may result in a grade of zero.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>Late submissions of <em>worksheets</em> and <em>tutorials</em>
            will receive a grade of 0. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> For other assessments, late submission is defined as
            any work submitted after the deadline. Late submissions
            will receive a 50% deduction penalty of the original grade
            in the first occurrence. Hence a maximum attainable grade
            for the first piece of work submitted late is 50%. Any additional
            pieces of work that are submitted late will receive a grade of 0
            for subsequent occurrences.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4> Free-pass </h4>
<p> Due to the extreme challenging circumstances we are facing,
    we are going to drop the lowest grade worksheet and tutorial (one of each).</p>

<h4> Autograder Policy </h4>
<p> Many of the questions in assignments are graded automatically by software.
    The grading computer has exactly the same hardware setup as the server that
    students work on. No assignment, when completed, should take longer than 5
    minutes to run on the server. The autograder will automatically stop (time out)
    for each student assignment after a maximum of 5 minutes;
    <em>any ungraded questions at that point will receive a score of 0.</em>
</p>

<p>Furthermore, students are responsible for making sure their assignments are <em>reproducible</em>,
    and run from beginning to end on the autograding computer. In particular, <em>please ensure
        that any data that needs to be downloaded is done so by the assignment notebook with the correct
        filename to the correct folder.</em> A common mistake is to manually download data when
    working on the assignment, making the autograder unable to find the data and often resulting in
    an assignment grade of 0. Even small mistakes such as using the wrong sample size will justify
    an incorrect response for that (and possibly downstream) questions.</p>

<p><strong>In short: whatever grade the autograder returns after 5 minutes
        (assuming the teaching team did not make an error) is the grade that will be assigned.</strong></p>

<p>Tip: when you're done the assignment, click "Restart and Run All",
    and check that the autograder returns the results you are expecting.</p>

<h4> Regrading</h4>
<p> If you have concerns about the way your work was graded, please open a request
    within one week of having the grade returned to you. After this one-week window,
    we may deny your request for re-evaluation. Also, please keep in mind that your
    grade may go up or down as a result of re-grading. To open a regrade requests,
    please follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p> Go to Piazza and click on <code>New post</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> In <code>Post Type</code>, select <code>Question</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> Make the post private to instructors and TAs only.
            In <code>Post to</code> select <code>Individual Students(s)/Instructor(s)</code>.
            A text box will appear, where you must type <code>Instructors</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> In <code>Select Folder(s)</code> select the folder <code>regrading</code></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> In <code>Summary</code> say the Assignment you want to be regraded,
            followed by the question and your name and student number.
            For example, <code>lab 3 -> Q3 -- Rodolfo Lourenzutti (9982313)</code></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Provide a brief reason for why the regrade is needed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The TAs will see the request and will take a look at the assignment.
            If necessary, they will involve the instructors.
            Finally, once the TA is finished reassessing the assignment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If the grade deserves more marks: the TA will update the mark
                    on Canvas and comment on the question so everyone can see that
                    the question has been addressed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If your grade goes down or stays the same: the TA will answer
                    the post on Piazza, giving the student a reason for their final decision</p>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>



<h4> Device/Browser</h4>
<p>Students are responsible for using a device and browser compatible with all functionality of Canvas.
    Chrome or Firefox browsers are recommended; Safari has had issues with Canvas quizzes in the past.</p>

<h4>Exams</h4>
<p>In this course, two 45-minute mid-terms will be administered at the start
    of the lecture in Weeks 5 and 9. Besides, there will be a two-hour final exam.
    Notwithstanding the grading weights <a href="#course-breakdown">above</a>, students must
    pass the final exam to pass the course. All the exams will be open-book; however,
    you are not allowed to communicate with another person during the exams.</p>

<h4> Missed Final Exam </h4>
<p> Students who miss the final exam must report to their faculty advising office within
    72 hours of the missed exam, and must supply supporting documentation.
    Only your faculty advising office can grant deferred standing in a course.
    You must also notify your instructor prior to (if possible) or immediately after the exam.
    Your instructor will let you know when you are expected to write your deferred exam.
    Deferred exams will ONLY be provided to students who have applied for and received
    deferred standing from their faculty.</p>

<h4>Academic Concession Policy</h4>
<p>Please see <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,329,0,0">
        UBC's concession policy</a> for detailed information on dealing with missed coursework,
    quizzes, and exams under circumstances of an acute and unanticipated nature.</p>

<h4> Academic Integrity </h4>
<p>The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity.
    As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and
    follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level,
    this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources
    of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means
    you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of
    academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic
    enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are
    imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the
    assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the
    President's Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in order to
    monitor and prevent recurrences.</p>

<p>A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University's policies and procedures,
    may be found in the <a href="http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0">Academic Calendar</a>.
</p>

<h4> Plagiarism </h4>
<p>Students must correctly cite any code or text that has been authored
    by someone else or by the student themselves for other assignments.
    Cases of plagiarism may include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>the reproduction (copying and pasting) of code or text with none or minimal reformatting (e.g., changing
            the name of the variables)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>the translation of an algorithm or a script from a language to another</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>the generation of code by automatic code-generation software</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>An “adequate acknowledgement” requires a detailed identification of the
    (parts of the) code or text reused and a full citation of the original
    source code that has been reused.</p>

<p>The above attribution policy applies only to assignments.
    <strong>No code or text may be copied (with or without attribution)
        from any source during a quiz or exam.</strong> Answers must always be
    in your own words. At a minimum, copying will result in a
    grade of 0 for the related question.
</p>

<p>Repeated plagiarism of any form could result in larger penalties, including failure of the course.</p>
