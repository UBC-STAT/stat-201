## Covid Safety 

### Classroom Instructions

For our in-person meetings in this class, it is important that all of us feel as comfortable as possible engaging in class activities while sharing an indoor space. 

- **Masks:** Masks **are required** for all for all indoor public spaces on campus, including classrooms, as per the BC Public Health Officer orders. Mask wearing protects you as well as others in your environment. **Let’s do everything we can as a community to stop the spread of this virus**. 
 - You will need to wear a medical or non-medical mask for the duration of our class meetings, for your own protection, and the safety and comfort of everyone else in the class.

 - For the purposes of this order, the term “masks” refers to medical and non-medical masks that cover our noses and mouths.  Masks are a primary tool to make it harder for Covid-19 to find a new host.  
     
 - You may be asked to remove your mask briefly for an ID check for an exam, but otherwise, your mask should cover your nose and mouth. Please <em>do not eat in class</em>. If you need to drink water/coffee/tea/etc, please keep your mask on between sips. 

 - Students who need to request an exemption to the indoor mask mandate must do so based on
one of the grounds for exemption detailed in the [PHO Order on Face Coverings (COVID-19)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/covid-19/covid-19-pho-order-face-coverings.pdf). Such requests must be made through the [Center for Accessibility](info.accessibility@ubc.ca). Students who cannot wear masks are equally welcome in our class. 

- **Vaccination:** If you have not yet had a chance to get vaccinated against Covid-19, vaccines are available to you, free, and on campus: visit [https://planning.ubc.ca/news/how-get-covid-19-vaccine-clinic-ubc](https://planning.ubc.ca/news/how-get-covid-19-vaccine-clinic-ubc) and [http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/covid-19-vaccine](http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/covid-19-vaccine) for more information.
    - The higher the rate of vaccination in our community overall, the lower the chance of spreading this virus.  You are an important part of the UBC community. Please arrange to get vaccinated if you have not already done so. 

- **Seating in class:** To reduce the risk of Covid transmission, please sit in a consistent area of the classroom each day.  This will minimize your contacts and will still allow for the pedagogical methods planned for this class to help your learning.  

### Your personal health

If you’re sick, it’s important that you stay home – no matter what you think you may be sick with (e.g., cold, flu, other).
  
- A daily self-health assessment is required before attending campus. Every day, before coming to class, complete the self-assessment for Covid symptoms using this tool: [https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en](https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en)

-   Do not come to class if you have Covid symptoms, have recently tested positive for Covid, or are required to quarantine. You can check this website to find out if you should self-isolate or self-monitor: [http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/self-isolation#Who](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/self-isolation#Who). 

- Your precautions will help reduce risk and keep everyone safer.  In this class, the marking scheme is intended to provide flexibility so that you can prioritize your health and still be able to succeed: 
    - You can complete the worksheets from your home if you cannot attend class. 
    - We will automatically drop your lowest score among the worksheets. 
    - We will automatically drop your lowest score among the tutorials.

#### Missing lecture(s) because of illness: 

**If you’re sick, it’s important that you stay home. Do not come to class**

- Make a connection early in the term to another student or a group of students in the class.  You can help each other by sharing notes.  If you don’t yet know anyone in the class, post on the PIAZZA discussion forum to connect with other students. 
- Consult the class resources on this class website regularly. We will post all the slides, readings, worksheets, tutorials and recordings for each class day.  
- Use the PIAZZA online discussion forum for help.
- Come to virtual office hours.
- See the marking scheme for reassurance about what flexibility you have. 
- If you are concerned that you will need to miss a particular key activity due to illness, contact us to discuss. 

#### Missing a midterm because of illness: 
If you are sick on a midterm exam day, **please do not attend the exam**. 
- Email the instructors as soon as you are confident you should not come to the scheduled exam.  We would strongly prefer that you contact us to make an alternate arrangement than for you to come to the exam while you are ill.  
- If you do show up for an exam and you are clearly ill, you will not be able to write the exam and we will make alternate arrangements with you.  It is much better for you to email ahead of time and not attend.  <em>Remember to include your full name and student number in your message</em>. 

#### Missing the final because of illness: 
If you are sick on a final exam day, **please do not attend the exam**. 
- You **must** report to their faculty advising office within 48 hours of the missed exam, and must apply for deferred standing: https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/academic-learning-resources/academic-advising. Only **your faculty advising office** can grant deferred standing in a course. 

If you're a <em>Science student</em>, you must apply for deferred standing (an academic concession) through Science Advising no later than 48 hours after the missed final exam/assignment. Learn more and find the application online:https://science.ubc.ca/students/advising/concession.

- Students who are granted deferred standing write the final exam/assignment at a later date.Your instructor will let you know when you are expected to write your deferred exam. Deferred exams will ONLY be provided to students who have applied for and received deferred standing from their faculty.

- You must also notify your instructor prior to (if possible) or immediately after the exam. 

For additional information about academic concessions, see the UBC policy here: [http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,329,0,0](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,329,0,0).

### Instructor health

We, the instructors, will do our best to stay well, but if we are ill, develop Covid symptoms, or test positive for Covid, we will not come to class.  If that happens, here’s what you can expect 
- The other instructor (Gaby or Rodolfo) will substitute.
- If we are well enough to teach but are taking precautions to avoid infecting others, we will have a synchronous online session.  If this happens, you will receive an email and an announcement in Canvas telling you how to join the class.  You can anticipate that this would very likely be a last-minute email.  Our classroom will still be available for you to sit and attend an online session in this (hopefully rare) instance, and one of the TAs will attend to answer questions in person.
- One of your TAs has been training to teach, and they will substitute in the very rare event that both of us are sick at the same time.
