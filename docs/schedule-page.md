All due dates will be on the last day of the week (Saturday at 23:59:59).

#### Test Dates

- Midterm 1: Tuesday, July 20 at 2:30pm
- Midterm 2: Tuesday, August 3 at 2:30pm
- Final Exam: Tue Aug 17 2021, 15:30 pm.

### Learning Outcomes per Week

#### Week 1: Introduction to Statistical Inference and Sampling

From this section, students are expected to be able to:

- Describe real-world examples of questions that can be answered
with the statistical inference methods presented in this course
(e.g., estimation, hypothesis testing).
- Name common population parameters (mean, proportion, median, variance, standard deviation, and correlation) that are often
estimated using sample data, and write computer scripts to calculate
estimates of these parameters.
- Define the following terms in relation to statistical inference:
population, sample, population parameters, estimate, sampling distribution, sample distribution.
- Write an R script to draw random samples from a finite population (e.g., census data).
- Write an R script to reveal a sampling distribution from a finite population.

#### Week 2: Populations and Sampling

From this section, students are expected to be able to:

- Compare and contrast quantitative and categorical variables.
- Explain random and representative sampling and how this can influence estimation.
- Define random variables and explain how they relate to sampling.
- Define standard error and explain its purpose.
- Compare and contrast population distribution, sample distribution and an estimator's sampling
distribution.
- Explain what a sampling distribution is, list its properties, and its purpose in statistical
inference.

#### Week 3: Bootstrapping and its Relationship to the Sampling Distribution

From this section, students are expected to be able to:

- Explain why we don’t know/have a sampling distribution in practice/real life.
- Define bootstrapping.
- Write a computer script to create a bootstrap distribution to approximate a sampling distribution.
- Contrast the bootstrap sampling distribution with an assumed sampling distribution.
- Estimate the standard error of an estimator using bootstrapping.

#### Week 4: Confidence Intervals via Bootstrapping

From this section, students are expected to be able to:

- Define and calculate sample quantiles.
- Define what a confidence interval is, and why we want to generate one.
- Explain how the bootstrap sampling distribution can be used to create confidence intervals.
- Write a computer script to calculate confidence intervals for a population parameter using
bootstrapping.
- Effectively visualize point estimates and confidence intervals.
- Interpret and explain results from confidence intervals.
- Discuss the potential limitations of these methods.

#### Week 5: Mid-term #1 and Preparation for Projects

In this week, students will write a mid-term exam, and begin working on their projects. Also from this
section, students are expected to be able to

- Propose parameters that are useful, given the type of data.
- Propose parameters that are useful, given a question.
- Choose an appropriate way to present estimator uncertainty, given a question, by comparing and
contrasting the usefulness of confidence intervals vs. standard error.
- Calculate, interpret, and visualize prediction intervals.

#### Week 6: Hypothesis Testing via Simulation/Randomization

From this section, students are expected to be able to:

- Give an example of a question you could answer with a hypothesis test.
- Differentiate composite vs. simple hypotheses.
- Given an inferential question, formulate null and alternative hypotheses to be used in a hypothesis
test.
- Identify the steps and components of a basic hypothesis test ("there is only one hypothesis test").
- Write computer scripts to perform hypothesis testing via simulation, randomization and bootstrapping
approaches, as well as interpret the output.
- Describe the relationship between confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.
- Discuss the potential limitations of this simulation approach to hypothesis testing.


#### Week 7: Confidence Intervals (of means and proportions) Based on the Assumption of Normality or the Central Limit Theorem

From this section, students are expected to be able to:

- Describe the Law of Large Numbers.
- Describe a normal distribution.
- Explain the Central Limit Theorem and its role in constructing confidence intervals.
- Write a computer script to calculate confidence intervals based on the assumption of normality / the
Central Limit Theorem.
- Discuss the potential limitations of these methods.
- Decide whether to use asymptotic theory or bootstrapping to compute estimator uncertainty.

#### Week 8: Classical Tests Based on Normal and t-Distributions

From this section, students are expected to be able to:

- Describe a t-distribution and its relationship with the normal distribution.
- Use results from the assumption of normality or the Central Limit Theorem to perform estimation and
hypothesis testing.
- Compare and contrast the parts of estimation and hypothesis testing that differ between simulation-
and resampling-based approaches with the assumption of normality or the Central Limit Theorem- based
approaches.
- Write a computer script to perform hypothesis testing based on results from the assumption of
normality or the Central Limit Theorem.
- Discuss the potential limitations of these methods.

#### Week 9: Mid-term #2 Introduction of Methods Based on Exact and Asymptotic Distributional Theory

#### Week 10: Errors in Inference

From this section, students are expected to be able to:

- Define type I & II errors.
- Define power of a test.
- Describe responsible use and reporting of p-values from hypothesis tests.
- Discuss how these errors are linked to a "reproducibility crisis".
- Measure how these errors amplify when performing multiple hypothesis testing, in the context of
multiple comparisons.

#### Week 11: Beyond two-group comparisons

From this section, students are expected to be able to:

- Run a simple one-way ANOVA, without knowing the details of the test.
- Apply FDR or Bonferroni correction to control the errors when performing multiple hypothesis testing.
- The value of presenting an entire distribution as a prediction.
- Estimate a population distribution using simulation (if there's time). Example: [wedding planning](https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/post/party-planning-probability/)

#### Week 12: Project Week

This week is designed as independent studying where the students will be working on a project that aims at
answering an inferential question with the material they have learned from weeks 1-11.
