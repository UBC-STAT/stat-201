    "## 1. Short Recap & Warm-Up Question\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis testing problem is very similar to the confidence intervals problem you learned in Week 4.  There is just a shift in focus. For confidence intervals, we want to find plausible values for the parameter given a sample. In hypothesis testing, we want to find  \"plausible\" values for a statistic given a fixed value for the parameter. For example,  given a sample average $\\bar{x}=2$, confidence intervals aim to find plausible values for the populational mean $\\mu$. On the other hand, hypothesis tests assume a population parameter, say $\\mu=2$, and aims to check if the obtained $\\bar{x}$ is \"compatible\" with that value.\n",

The bigger this overlap is, higher is chance that the actual sampling distribution generates a test statistic in the region of non-rejection of $H_0$ (imagine moving the red distribution towards the right). Unfortunately, for a given sample size, we cannot reduce the probability of type II error without increasing the probability of type I error. \n",
