    "For this section, we are going to study the case where we want to test a proportion. As a matter of fact, this is just a particular case of the previous section (testing the mean); after all, the proportion is nothing else than the mean of a 0-1 random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cases to be considered are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- $H_0: p = p_0$ vs $H_1: p < p_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $H_0: p = p_0$ vs $H_1: p > p_0$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "Z = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p_0}{\\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)/n}}\n",

    "where $\\hat{p}$ is the sample proportion, $n$ is the sample size, and $p_0$ is the value of $p$ under $H_0$. Since, in this case, the population distribution is clearly not Normal (the random variable is a 0-1 variable), we need to rely on the CLT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the sample size is large enough, the null model (i.e., the sampling distribution under $H_0$) of the test statistic $Z$ is approximately $N(0, 1)$. Roughly speaking, if the sample size is such that $n p_0 \\geq 10$ and $n(1-p_0)\\geq 10$, the approximation of the null-model by the standard Gaussian is fairly good."

Consider the situation where the elements in Population A are paired with elements in Population B. In this case, if you choose an element in Population A, you automatically choose an element in Population B. In this sense, the samples from the two populations are not independent. However, the sample pairs must be chosen independently. Compare the diagram below with the one of two-sample t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/paired-t-test.png\" width=700px/>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we want to check if the training provided by a personal trainer increases endurance. To measure this effect, we ask 50 people to go over the entire training. Before the training starts, we measure how long (in seconds) each of the 50 participants can keep up running at their maximum speed. After training for one month, we measure how long the participants can keep up running at their maximum speed.\n",
    "Note how the first and second measurements are paired, and therefore are not independent. We cannot use the two-sample t-test in this case because it assumes that the samples are independent. What should we do?\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by taking the difference of measurements: $d_i = y_i - x_i$. Then, we can apply the one-sample t-test to the differences. Cool, right? But remember from the one-sample t-test: \n",
    " - if the distribution of $d$ is Normal, we should be fine with the one-sample t-test even for small sample sizes;\n",
    " - if the distribution of $d$ is far from Normal, then a larger sample size is needed before the CLT \"kicks in\" and the one-sample t-test becomes appropriate. Usually, a sample of size 30 tends to be sufficient."
