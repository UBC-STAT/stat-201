In this week, students will write a mid-term exam, and begin working on their projects.
Also from this section, students are expected to be able to
1.	Propose parameters that are useful, given the type of data.
2.	Propose parameters that are useful, given a question.
3.  Choose an appropriate way to present estimator uncertainty, given a question, by comparing and contrasting the usefulness of confidence intervals vs. standard error.
4.  Calculate, interpret, and visualize prediction intervals.

### Week 6: Hypothesis Testing via Simulation/Randomization
From this section, students are expected to be able to:
1.	Give an example of a question you could answer with a hypothesis test.
2.  Differentiate composite vs. simple hypotheses.
3.  Given an inferential question, formulate null and alternative hypotheses to be used in a hypothesis test.
5.	Identify the steps and components of a basic hypothesis test ("there is only one hypothesis test").
6.	Write computer scripts to perform hypothesis testing via simulation, randomization and bootstrapping approaches, as well as interpret the output.
8.	Describe the relationship between confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.
9.	Discuss the potential limitations of this simulation approach to hypothesis testing.

### Week 7: Confidence Intervals (of means and proportions) Based on the Assumption of Normality or the Central Limit Theorem
From this section, students are expected to be able to:
1.	Describe the Law of Large Numbers.
2.	Describe a normal distribution.
3.	Explain the Central Limit Theorem and its role in constructing confidence intervals.
4.	Write a computer script to calculate confidence intervals based on the assumption of normality / the Central Limit Theorem.
5.	Discuss the potential limitations of these methods.
6.	Decide whether to use asymptotic theory or bootstrapping to compute estimator uncertainty.

### Week 8: Classical Tests Based on Normal and t- Distributions
From this section, students are expected to be able to:
1.	Describe a t-distribution and its relationship with the normal distribution.
2.	Use results from the assumption of normality or the Central Limit Theorem to perform estimation and hypothesis testing.
3.	Compare and contrast the parts of estimation and hypothesis testing that differ between simulation- and resampling-based approaches with the assumption of normality or the Central Limit Theorem- based approaches.
4.	Write a computer script to perform hypothesis testing based on results from the assumption of normality or the Central Limit Theorem.
5.	Discuss the potential limitations of these methods.


### Week 9: Mid-term #2 and Project Work


### Week 10: Errors in Inference
From this section, students are expected to be able to:
1.	Define type I & II errors.
2.	Describe responsible use and reporting of p-values from hypothesis tests.
3.	Discuss how these errors are linked to a "reproducibility crisis".
4.  Measure how these errors amplify when performing multiple hypothesis testing, in the context of multiple comparisons. 


### Week 11: Beyond two-group comparisons
From this section, students are expected to be able to:
1.  Run a simple one-way ANOVA, without knowing the details of the test.
2.  Apply FDR or Bonferroni correction to control the errors when performing multiple hypothesis testing.
3.  The value of presenting an entire distribution as a prediction. 
4.  Estimate a population distribution using simulation (if there's time). Example: wedding planning: https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/post/party-planning-probability/


### Week 12: Project Week
This week is designed as independent studying where the students will be working on a project that aims at answering an inferential question with the material they have learned from weeks 1-11.
